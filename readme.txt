dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
# Luke's build of st - the simple (suckless) terminal

The [suckless terminal (st)](https://st.suckless.org/) with some additional
features that make it literally the best terminal emulator ever:

## Unique features (using dmenu)

+ **follow urls** by pressing `alt-l`
+ **copy urls** in the same way with `alt-y`
+ **copy the output of commands** with `alt-o`

## Bindings for

+ **scrollback** with `alt-↑/↓` or `alt-pageup/down` or `shift` while scrolling the
  mouse.
+ OR **vim-bindings**: scroll up/down in history with `alt-k` and `alt-j`.
  Faster with `alt-u`/`alt-d`.
+ **zoom/change font size**: same bindings as above, but holding down shift as
  well. `alt-home` returns to default
+ **copy text** with `alt-c`, **paste** is `alt-v` or `shift-insert`

## Pretty stuff

+ Compatibility with `Xresources` and `pywal` for dynamic colors.
+ Default [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) colors otherwise.
+ Transparency/alpha, which is also adjustable from your `Xresources`.
+ Default font is system "mono" at 14pt, meaning the font will match your
  system font.

## Other st patches

+ Boxdraw
+ Ligatures
+ font2
+ updated to latest version 0.8.4

## Installation for newbs

You should have xlib header files and libharfbuzz build files installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/st
cd st
sudo make install
```

Obviously, `make` is required to build. `fontconfig` is required for the
default build, since it asks `fontconfig` for your system monospace font. It
might be obvious, but `libX11` and `libXft` are required as well. Chances are,
you have all of this installed already.

On OpenBSD, be sure to edit `config.mk` first and remove `-lrt` from the
`$LIBS` before compiling.

Be sure to have a composite manager (`xcompmgr`, `picom`, etc.) running if you
want transparency.

## How to configure dynamically with Xresources

For many key variables, this build of `st` will look for X settings set in
either `~/.Xdefaults` or `~/.Xresources`. You must run `xrdb` on one of these
files to load the settings.

For example, you can define your desired fonts, transparency or colors:

```
*.font:	Liberation Mono:pixelsize=12:antialias=true:autohint=true;
*.alpha: 0.9
*.color0: #111
...
```

The `alpha` value (for transparency) goes from `0` (transparent) to `1`
(opaque). There is an example `Xdefaults` file in this respository.

### Colors

To be clear about the color settings:

- This build will use gruvbox colors by default and as a fallback.
- If there are Xresources colors defined, those will take priority.
- But if `wal` has run in your session, its colors will take priority.

Note that when you run `wal`, it will negate the transparency of existing windows, but new windows will continue with the previously defined transparency.

## Notes on Emojis and Special Characters

If st crashes when viewing emojis, install
[libxft-bgra](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libxft-bgra/) from the AUR.

Note that some special characters may appear truncated if too wide. You might
want to manually set your prefered emoji/special character font to a lower size
in the `config.h` file to avoid this. By default, JoyPixels is used at a
smaller size than the usual text.

slstatus - suckless status
==========================
slstatus is a suckless status monitor for window managers that use WM_NAME
(e.g. dwm) or stdin to fill the status bar.


Features
--------
- Battery percentage/state/time left
- CPU usage
- CPU frequency
- Custom shell commands
- Date and time
- Disk status (free storage, percentage, total storage and used storage)
- Available entropy
- Username/GID/UID
- Hostname
- IP address (IPv4 and IPv6)
- Kernel version
- Keyboard indicators
- Keymap
- Load average
- Network speeds (RX and TX)
- Number of files in a directory (hint: Maildir)
- Memory status (free memory, percentage, total memory and used memory)
- Swap status (free swap, percentage, total swap and used swap)
- Temperature
- Uptime
- Volume percentage
- WiFi signal percentage and ESSID


Requirements
------------
Currently slstatus works on FreeBSD, Linux and OpenBSD.
In order to build slstatus you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (slstatus is installed into the
/usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install slstatus (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running slstatus
----------------
See the man page for details.


Configuration
-------------
slstatus can be customized by creating a custom config.h and (re)compiling the
source code. This keeps it fast, secure and simple.


Upcoming
--------

A release (v1.0) will come soon... ;)
After a long phase of inactivity, development has been continued!
dmenu - dynamic menu
====================
dmenu is an efficient dynamic menu for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dmenu you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dmenu is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dmenu
(if necessary as root):

    make clean install
